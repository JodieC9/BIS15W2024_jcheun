Hello there! Welcome to my repository for the BIS 015L course at UC Davis. Here you will find various assignments that track my journey in learning R Studio. 

###Introduction 
A little bit about me! I am a 3rd year Animal Biology major and Wildlife, Fish, and Conservation minor on the pre-veterinary track. After undergrad, I will pursue veterinary medicine and likely specialize in companion/small animal emergency medicine.
