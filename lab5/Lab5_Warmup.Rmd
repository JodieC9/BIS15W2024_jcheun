## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:
##1. Load the data

```{r}
getwd()
```


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```
```{r}
fish <- read_csv("data/Gaeta_etal_CLC_data.csv")
```
##2. Transform the data to only include lakeid and length 
```{r}
names(fish)
```

```{r}
fishlength <- select(fish, "length", "lakeid")
```
When you run this command, you made a NEW dataframe. Data.frame command is only used when you have raw data, here we have the csv file already aka already have the dataframe dont need to make a new one. 

##3. Filter the fish for lake BO 
```{r}
glimpse(fish)
```
Find out the class of the lakeid data. Note this is a chr in the dataset. 
```{r}
filter(fish, lakeid=="BO")
```
This commands filers the dataset to only include lake id results that really equal the BO requirment 

##4. Mean length of BO fish 
```{r}
fish_BO <- filter(fish, lakeid=="BO")
```

Here, we make a NEW dataframe that only includes the BO fish since these are the only guys we are intersted in 

```{r}
mean(fish_BO$length)
```

Alt method, you could put the filter(fish, lakeid=="BO") into the mean() command, but this is combining steps which may make youre data harder to interpret.
