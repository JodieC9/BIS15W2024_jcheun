## Learning Goals
*At the end of this exercise, you will be able to:*    
1. Use summary functions to assess the structure of a data frame.  
2. Us the select function of `dplyr` to build data frames restricted to variable of interest.  
3. Use the `rename()` function to provide new, consistent names to variables in data frames.  

## Load the tidyverse
For the remainder of the quarter, we will work within the `tidyverse`. At the start of each lab, the library needs to be loaded as shown below.  
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library("tidyverse")#
```

## Load the data
These data are from: Gaeta J., G. Sass, S. Carpenter. 2012. Biocomplexity at North Temperate Lakes LTER: Coordinated Field Studies: Large Mouth Bass Growth 2006. Environmental Data Initiative.  [link](https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/mapbrowse?scope=knb-lter-ntl&identifier=267)  
```{r}
fish <- readr::read_csv("data/Gaeta_etal_CLC_data.csv")
```
`readr` is a command to be explicit about the package we are using. Part of the tidyverse package. 

## Data Structure
Once data have been uploaded, let's get an idea of its structure, contents, and dimensions.  
```{r}
glimpse(fish)
```
```{r}
summary(fish)
```

## Tidyverse
The [tidyverse](www.tidyverse.org) is an "opinionated" collection of packages that make workflow in R easier. The packages operate more intuitively than base R commands and share a common organizational philosophy.  
![*Data Science Workflow in the Tidyverse.*](tidy-1.png)  

## dplyr
The first package that we will use that is part of the tidyverse is `dplyr`. `dplyr` is used to transform data frames by extracting, rearranging, and summarizing data such that they are focused on a question of interest. This is very helpful,  especially when wrangling large data, and makes dplyr one of most frequently used packages in the tidyverse. The two functions we will use most are `select()` and `filter()`.  

This packages allows you to chop up a dataframe to make it tidy. Helps you organize summaries about the data. Manage and explore data. 

## `select()`
Select allows you to pull out columns of interest from a dataframe. To do this, just add the names of the columns to the `select()` command. The order in which you add them, will determine the order in which they appear in the output.

Allows you to pull out columns of interest from the dataframe.
```{r}
names(fish)
```

We are only interested in lakeid and scalelength. AKA only a few of the total columns possible. Command tell us: select, name of the dataframe to look into, variables of interest in the dataframe 

because fish is an object, it does not have to be in quotes. 
```{r}
select(fish, "lakeid", "scalelength")
```

```{r}
names(fish)
```

What if we wanted to only pull out fish_id and length from the entire dataframe? Important to note, the order of the pull out variables is the order it appears in the "cut up" dataframe 
```{r}
select (fish, "fish_id","length")
```
```{r}
fish_subset <- select (fish, "length","fish_id")
```
In this command we create a subset of the dataframe that only inludes the variables we want 

To add a range of columns use `start_col:end_col`.
```{r}
select(fish, fish_id:length)
```

The - operator is useful in select. It allows us to select everything except the specified variables.

This command will select everything but the specified variable
```{r}
select(fish, -"fish_id", -"annnumber", -"length", -"radii_length_mm")
```

For very large data frames with lots of variables, `select()` utilizes lots of different operators to make things easier. Let's say we are only interested in the variables that deal with length.

```{r}
names(fish)
```

```{r}
select(fish, contains("length")) ##this command lets us pull out any variables that contains a keyword 
```

When columns are sequentially named, `starts_with()` makes selecting columns easier.
```{r}
select(fish, starts_with("radii"))
```

```{r}
select(fish, ends_with("radii"))
```

Options to select columns based on a specific criteria include:  
1. ends_with() = Select columns that end with a character string  
2. contains() = Select columns that contain a character string  
3. matches() = Select columns that match a regular expression  
4. one_of() = Select columns names that are from a group of names  

```{r}
names(fish)
```

```{r}
select(fish, ends_with("id"))
```

```{r}
select(fish, contains("fish"))
```

We won't cover regular expressions [regex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) in this class, but the following code is helpful when you know that a column contains a letter (in this case "a") followed by a subsequent string (in this case "er").  
```{r}
select(fish, matches("a.+er")) #handy but of code for the project. This command looks through the variables of interest to see if they have the letter a and ends with "er" 
```

You can also select columns based on the class of data.  
```{r}
glimpse(fish)
```

```{r}
select_if(fish, is.numeric)
```

To select all columns that are *not* a class of data, you need to add a `~`. The ~ says to pull out everything but what you specify 

"look in all variables in the fish dataframe and pull out all the data that is not numeric" The ! in this case means `not`. If you do not include it this same command will pull out all the variables that ARE the category you specify 
```{r}
select_if(fish, ~!is.numeric(.))
```

## Practice  
For this exercise we will use life history data `mammal_lifehistories_v2.csv` for mammals. The [data](http://esapubs.org/archive/ecol/E084/093/) are from:  
**S. K. Morgan Ernest. 2003. Life history characteristics of placental non-volant mammals. Ecology 84:3402.**  

Load the data.  
```{r}
mammals <- read.csv("data/mammal_lifehistories_v2.csv")
```
Whenever we import dataframe, we akready have the dataframe. Do not use a dataframe command after this point 

```{r}
mammals
```


1. Use one or more of your favorite functions to assess the structure of the data.  
```{r}
summary(mammals)
```
```{r}
glimpse(mammals)
```

2. Are there any NAs? Are you sure? Try taking an average of `max. life` as a test.  
```{r}
anyNA(mammals)
```

```{r}
any(is.na(mammals))
```

```{r}
summary(mammals)
```
But notice that even if there is no NA in the dataset, the summary function tells us the minimum mass is -999... this is impossible, be suspicious! 
```{r}
mean(mammals$max..life)
```

```{r}

```

3. What are the names of the columns in the `mammals` data?
```{r}
names(mammals)
```

4. Rename any columns that have capitol letters or punctuation issues.  

For the `rename` function list the new name assignment first that is applies to the old name we want to replace 

```{r}
mammals_new<- rename(mammals, genus="Genus", max_life="max..life", wean_mass="wean.mass", litter_size= "litter.size", litters_year="litters.year")
```

```{r}
mammals_new
```


5. We are only interested in the variables `genus`, `species`, and `mass`. Use `select()` to build a new dataframe `mass` focused on these variables.
```{r}
names(mammals_new)
```

```{r}
select(mammals_new, "genus", "species", "mass")
```

6. What if we only wanted to exclude `order` and `family`? Use the `-` operator to make the code efficient.
```{r}
select(mammals_new, -"order", -"family")
```
NOTE: if you did not put the - in front of the listed column names, you would pull out JUST the order and family columns

7. Select the columns that include "mass" as part of the name.  
```{r}
select(mammals_new, contains("mass"))
```

8. Select all of the columns that are of class `character`.  
```{r}
select_if(mammals_new, ~is.character(.))
```
Here we pulled out all the columns with chr class of data 

```{r}
select(mammals_new, is.character)
```
to get rid of the errors, use the select if instead of just select 
## Other
Here are two examples of code that are super helpful to have in your bag of tricks.  

Imported data frames often have a mix of lower and uppercase column names. Use `toupper()` or `tolower()` to fix this issue. I always try to use lowercase to keep things consistent.  
```{r}
select_all(mammals, tolower)
```

```{r}
library(janitor)
names(mammals)
```

```{r}
clean_names(mammals)
```

Once you have the janitor library, you can just use the clean_names command to automatically clean up all the column names to be aligned with tidyverse code 

When naming columns, blank spaces are often added (don't do this, please). Here is a trick to remove these.  
```{r}
#select_all(mammals, ~str_replace(., " ", "_"))
```

## That's it! Let's take a break and then move on to part 2!
